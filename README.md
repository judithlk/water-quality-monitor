<h1>Water Quality Monitor</h1>

<h4>Hello! Thank you for checking this out.</h4>

This project is actually the web interface of a water quality monitoring system, also a semester project for school.

This web app was built with <b>ReactJS</b> and <b>Firebase</b> was used to receive and update the app with real-time readings from our device.
It was my first time working with Firebase as the backend of my project and I must say I enjoyed it.

The charts are powered by <a href="https://apexcharts.com/">Apex Charts</a>, but you can go through the code to see how I tweaked them to get my desired output.

The responsiveness was taken care of using react-bootstrap <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-bootstrap">react-boostrap</a> and the icon is from <a href="https://fontawesome.com/">Font Awesome</a>

You can view the live site <a href="https://water-quality-monitor-5c9df.web.app/">here</a>. It was hosted with from Google Firebase Console.

Please leave a star. Thank you!
